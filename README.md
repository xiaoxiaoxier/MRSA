# Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria Risk Assessment Framework
This repository contains the code and data necessary to reproduce the results of a study aimed at developing a novel risk assessment framework for Staphylococcus aureus, one of the most critical multidrug-resistant bacteria. The framework accurately predicts the resistance to multiple antibiotics, providing an efficient method for early antibiotic decision-making and a better understanding of the multidrug resistance risk of Staphylococcus aureus.
