# Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria Risk Assessment Framework
This repository contains the code and data necessary to reproduce the results of a study aimed at developing a novel risk assessment framework for Staphylococcus aureus, one of the most critical multidrug-resistant bacteria. The framework accurately predicts the resistance to multiple antibiotics, providing an efficient method for early antibiotic decision-making and a better understanding of the multidrug resistance risk of Staphylococcus aureus.
# Requirements
- R (version >= 3.0.0): (https://www.r-project.org/)
- R packages:
    - dplyr (version >= 1.1.1)
    - xgboost (version >= 1.7.5)
    - pROC (version >= 1.18.2)
    - tidyr (version >= 1.3.0)
    - ggplot2 (version >= 3.4.1)
# Usage
To use the code provided and reproduce the results of [A Risk Assessment Framework for Multidrug-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Using Machine Learning and Mass Spectrometry Technology], follow the steps below:

1. Download the four CSV data files:
    - `ion_matrix_linkou.csv`: mass spectrometry ion matrix for LiuKou samples
    - `label_linkou.csv`: corresponding resistance labels for LiuKou samples (1 for drug resistance, 0 for no drug resistance)
    - `ion_matrix_kaohsiung.csv`: mass spectrometry ion matrix for Kaohsiung samples
    - `label_kaohsiung.csv`: corresponding resistance labels for Kaohsiung samples

2. Place the downloaded data files in the appropriate directory of your project.

3. Ensure that R (version >= 3.0.0) is installed on your system. You can download R from the [official website](https://www.r-project.org/).

4. Install the necessary R packages by running the following commands:

```shell
install.packages("package1")
install.packages("package2")
install.packages("package3")
```
5. Run the provided code using your preferred R development environment or by executing the corresponding R script.
```
# Load the required packages
library(package1)
library(package2)
library(package3)

# Load the data
ion_matrix_linkou <- read.csv("ion_matrix_linkou.csv")
label_linkou <- read.csv("label_linkou.csv")
ion_matrix_kaohsiung <- read.csv("ion_matrix_kaohsiung.csv")
label_kaohsiung <- read.csv("label_kaohsiung.csv")

# Train and evaluate the machine learning models
# Add code snippets here to process the data, train models, plot ROC curves
# and calculate multi-drug resistance prediction scores
```
Please note that you may need to modify the above code to suit your specific implementation requirements and file paths. Refer to the original paper for detailed information on the algorithms and techniques used in the analysis.

# Data
The data used in this study can be found in the data directory. The .csv files contain the susceptibility testing profiles for four antibiotics, which were used to train and test the models.
